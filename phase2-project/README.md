PHASE 2 PROJECT

You must make a single page application (only one index.html file) using create-react-app.

Your app should use at least 5 components in a way that keeps your code well organized.

There should be at least 3 client-side routes using React Router Links to an external site.. Be sure to include a nav bar or other UI element that allows users to navigate between routes. Use RESTful routing conventions where applicable.

Use a json-server to create a RESTful API for your backend and make both a GET and a POST request to the json server. Use a form to make your post request, specifically a controlled form/component. Additionally, you may choose to incorporate data from an external API but it is not required.

    You should keep your json-server data simple: avoid nested data and associations. You'll learn how to work with more complex data in the next two phases. Focus on the frontend for this project.

    Upon return of json from your POST request, a state update by a setState function is required!

Add some styling: you're encouraged to write your CSS from scratch, either by using styled components Links to an external site.or writing CSS files and using id/className to style your elements. You can also incorporate a UI framework (like React Bootstrap Links to an external site., Semantic UI Links to an external site., or Material UI Links to an external site.) if you prefer.
